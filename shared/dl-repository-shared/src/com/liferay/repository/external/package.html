<p>
This package contains the interfaces exported by the <b>dl-repository-shared</b> 
framework to allow for third party implementation of external repositories for
Liferay Portal.
</p>
<p>
The best way to know how to use this framework is to look at an existing 
implementation (like Sharepoint or Google Drive external repositories) but we 
will explain the overall idea here.
</p>
<p>
When implementing an external repository, you need to provide implementations
for four main interfaces, namely: ExtRepository, ExtRepositoryFileEntry, 
ExtRepositoryFolder and ExtRepositoryFileVersion. The first is in charge of the
communication between Liferay and the back end repositories. The three last 
interfaces describe the objects stored in the back end repository: folders, 
files and versions.
<p>
<p>
The classes implementing ExtRepositoryFileEntry, ExtRepositoryFolder and 
ExtRepositoryFileVersion usually make a bridge between the methods of these 
interfaces and the methods in the back end repository API. For instance, they 
may map Liferay's filename field to the back end repository field holding the 
filename (example: field ows_BaseName in Sharepoint).
<p>
<p>
The ExtRepositoryFileEntry, ExtRepositoryFolder and ExtRepositoryFileVersion
are inside a hierarchy where two more interfaces exist: ExtRepositoryObject and
ExtRepositoryModel. The first one defines the properties which files and folders
have in common, while the latter has properties which are common to all three
main types: files, folders and versions. Implementors are free to define their
own class hierarchy to implement these interfaces, but are advised to create 
one abstract class for ExtRepositoryObject and another one for 
ExtRepositoryModel so that they can be extended by the implementations of 
ExtRepositoryFileEntry, ExtRepositoryFolder and ExtRepositoryFileVersion. It 
should be noted that the abstract implementation of ExtRepositoryObject should
extends the abstract implementation of ExtRepositoryObject to be coherent.
<p>

<p>
When implementing ExtRepository, all methods returning or receiving and 
ExtRepositoryFileEntry, ExtRepositoryFolder and ExtRepositoryFileVersion must
assume that even if the instances have the types of the interfaces, they, in 
reality, are implemented by the classes described in the previous paragraph.
That is, if you are implementing a Sharepoint external repository, you return 
SharepointFileEntry objects when called by Liferay, and Liferay will give you
SharepointFileEntry as arguments to the methods.
<p>

<p>
To finish with, all data interchanged between Liferay and the implementations
is in the back end repository native format. These includes object keys and
user names. Liferay automatically converts these keys and user names to 
Liferay's ids and user names, possibly with the help of some methods defined in
ExtRepository (for instance: getLiferayUserName() must map back end repository 
user names to Liferay user names).
